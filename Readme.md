# Subsequence
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

// For uppercase alphabet (A-Z)
for (let i = 65; i <= 90; i++) {
  console.log(String.fromCharCode(i));
}

// For lowercase alphabet (a-z)
for (let i = 97; i <= 122; i++) {
  console.log(String.fromCharCode(i));
}
