/** Given are the two distinct words startWord and targetWord, and a list of size N, denoting wordList

Keep the following conditions in mind:

A word can only consist of lowercase characters.
Only one letter can be changed in each transformation.
Each transformed word must exist in the wordList including the targetWord.
startWord may or may not be part of the wordList

Note: If thereâ€™s no possible way to transform the sequence from startWord to targetWord return 0.
