Trie is a data structure that is like a tree data structure in its organisation. It consists of nodes that store letters or alphabets of words, which can be added, retrieved, and deleted from it in a very efficient way.

In other words, Trie is an information retrieval data structure, which can beat naive data structures like Hashmap, Tree, etc in the time complexity of its operations.

The Trie data structure is used to efficiently store and retrieve a set of strings.

It organises strings such that common prefixes are shared among strings, making operations like searching for words with a given prefix efficient. Trie allows for quick retrieval of all strings with a given prefix, making it highly efficient for autocomplete and predictive text applications.

A Trie node is a data structure used to construct Trie. Each node contains the following components:

Links to Child Nodes: A Trie node contains an array of pointers called “links” or “pointer to children” for each letter of the lowercase alphabet. These pointers represent connections to child nodes corresponding to each letter of the alphabet. For instance, the link at index 0 corresponds to the child node representing the letter 'a', the link at index 1 corresponds to 'b', and so forth.
Flag for End of Word: Each Trie node contains a boolean flag indicating whether the node marks the end of a word. This flag is essential for distinguishing between prefixes and complete words stored in the Trie.
